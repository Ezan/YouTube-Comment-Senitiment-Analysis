I wish happiness was that semi colon you use while you're writing as essay; something that never really stopped; something you don't have to start it all over after using it; something that never lets you lose hope; something; something that you wouldn't bother if it's out; of place; something that never stops; unless you're dead.
Pagal baby

And if happiness was that what i wished it was, I'd have laughed at every fingers pointing at me calling me insane.

I would have taken your hand in the middle of a road and swayed you around  me.

In drought, I would have spit in the sky and not try to dodge it because I could feel the rain

I would have pushed a door that said pull and still find a way into your heart

I would have switched off the lights and still find you in front of me like a rising sun

I would have written lines and lines and you would have smiled and laughed after every page I turned.

We would have laughed the night away with you sipping on your bourbon and me playing my piano and your shadow dances like the movement of my fingers

I wish every mirror is an old photograph of us together, smiling


Never getting old
